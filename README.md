# 🏅 Rio 2016 Olympics Medal Analysis

###  Overview
This is my first R project where I practiced the fundamentals of R programming using the **Rio 2016 Olympics medal dataset**.  
The project focuses on basic data handling, computation, and visualization techniques in R.


###  Objectives
- Understand variables, data types, and operators in R  
- Learn data structures: vectors, matrices, lists, and data frames  
- Import CSV data into R and filter/sort it  
- Perform simple calculations and create a basic bar plot visualization  


### Insights
- **USA** dominated the 2016 Olympics with **121 total medals**
- **UK**, **China**, and **Russia** followed closely in the top ranks  
- Visualization clearly shows the medal gap between the top countries  


### What I Learned
- How to load and inspect datasets in R  
- How to manipulate data frames using indexing and sorting  
- How to visualize data using the `barplot()` function  
- How to use comments and Markdown to document a project properly
